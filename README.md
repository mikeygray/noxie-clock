# Noxie Clock

## Overview

A simple fitbit watch face, in honor of my cat Noxie. ðŸ˜º

It supports 12 hour and 24 hour digital displays, step counter, current heart rate and battery level
(with charging icon). It was planned to gather weather data from [openweather](https://openweathermap.org)
and update the background accordingly, though this is probably never going to roll out due to API restrictions
(see [this branch](https://github.com/mikeygray/noxie-clock/tree/feature/2-noxie-weather)). All features can be
switched on and off with settings in the FitBit mobile app.

Please feel free to fork, but credit is always nice.
