# Noxie Clock

## Overview

A simple fitbit watch face, in honor of my cat Noxie. ðŸ˜º

It supports 12 hour and 24 hour digital displays, step counter, current heart rate and battery level
(with charging icon). All of these can be switched on and off with settings in the FitBit mobile
app. Please feel free to fork, but credit is always nice.
